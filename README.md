# HTMLWindowSize
A simple program that finds the window size of an HTML document.

See it live on [GitHub Pages](http://seidobllik.github.io/HTMLWindowSize).

Features to add:
- make program entirely javascript based, so it can be added to other programs by simply adding a reference to the script. 
- height/width report should be displayed only when a window is resized, and disapear after 3-5 seconds. 
- report should show height with arrows in the middle left of the screen, and height with arrows in the middle bottom of the screen.
